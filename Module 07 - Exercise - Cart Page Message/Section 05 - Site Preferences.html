<h1>Site Preferences</h1>

<p>Site Preferences are another way to store and retrieve data from your sandbox and, in fact, are one of the <strong>System Object Types</strong>.</p>

<h2>Check Site Preferences Fields</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong>Administration > Development > System Object Types</strong></li>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Site Preferences</strong> item</li>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Attribute Definitions</strong> tab and have a look at the fields</li>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Attribute Grouping</strong> tab and have a look at the groups that are defined.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, it has many fields. A lot of things are saved as <strong>SitePreferences</strong>. Like you did with the Product System Object, try to create a new field for this object.</p>

<h2>Adding Value to Site Preferences Fields</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong>Merchant Tools > Site Preferences > Custom Preferences</strong></li>
  <li>You will see that, like other System Objects, fields are organized according to the Field Groups we create.</li>
  <li>You can either use one of the existing groups or create your own back in the <strong>Attribute Grouping</strong> tab</li>
  <li>Click on the grouping you want (for example, <strong>Storefront Configs</strong>)</li>
  <li>Now you can see the values stored for each field and modify them if you want</li>
</ol>

<h3>Retrieve Site Preferences in Code</h3>

<p>In order to retrieve any Site Preference using code, you only need to know the fieldâ€™s ID and use the following code:</p>

<pre><code>If you are trying to retrieve a Site Preference that was created out-of-the-box with your site:
dw.system.Site.getCurrent().getPreferences().<id_of_the_site_preference>

If you are trying to retrieve a Custom Site Preference created by you or your team:
dw.system.Site.getCurrent().getPreferences().custom.<id_of_the_site_preference></code></pre>
