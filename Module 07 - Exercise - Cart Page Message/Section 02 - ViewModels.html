<h1>How to Access ViewModel Data</h1>
<p>Once data is sent in our controller via <strong>setViewData()</strong> or via the second parameter in the <strong>res.render()</strong> function, it will be accessible in our templates via the <strong>pdict</strong> variable, as we learned in previous chapters. In our example, some model properties are used in the <strong>cart.isml</strong> template; take a look!</p>

<h2>ViewModels</h2>
<p>As we mentioned before, in SFCC, ViewModels are objects created specifically for the page we are rendering or the request we are responding to.</p>
<p>Whenever you see data being sent through the <strong>res.render</strong> or <strong>res.json</strong> functions and the data is inside curly braces { }, that‚Äôs your ViewModel.</p>
<p>To access it on your page, you just consider it as entries in your <strong>pdict</strong> object. For example, the Search Controller‚Äôs Refinebar endpoint:</p>
<p>Check how the <strong>search/searchRefineBar ISML</strong> template accesses the <strong>productSearch</strong> object because of the { } syntax: The objects are put inside <strong>pdict</strong>.</p>

<h2>üìù Exercise: Extending the Cart Model</h2>
<p>When loading the Cart page, we no longer have access to the notes (which the basket instance inherits from <strong>LineItemCtnr</strong>). But for the current project, when the user goes to the Cart page, we want to have access to those notes and, if there are none, display the following message: <strong>"You have no notes on your cart"</strong>.</p>
<p>The basket notes are inside the basket object retrieved by <strong>BasketMgr.getCurrentBasket()</strong>. If you open the official documentation for the <strong>Basket</strong> class, you will find that it has an attribute <strong>notes</strong> containing what we want.</p>
<p>Inside <strong>CartModel</strong>, we have the basket instance, which contains the notes array. So let's just add it to the model.</p>
