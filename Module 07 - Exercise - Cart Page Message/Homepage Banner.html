<h1>Exercise: Homepage Banner</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Create a Homepage banner using the Page Designer. The banner should effectively align with the current marketing campaign and meet all brand guidelines.</p>
<p>The banner must be visually appealing, with content that includes a headline, a brief description, and a call-to-action button. Ensure that the imagery is high-quality and optimized for both desktop and mobile views.</p>
<p>The banner needs to be fully responsive, adjusting seamlessly across different screen sizes. All interactive elements, such as buttons and links, should be functional, and accessibility considerations should be met by including appropriate alt text for images and ensuring overall readability.</p>
<p>Once the banner is configured, it should be placed correctly on the homepage and thoroughly tested across various devices and browsers to ensure it performs as expected. After implementation, submit the banner for review to the relevant stakeholders to obtain feedback and final approval.</p>
<p>Deliverables include a fully functional homepage banner within Page Designer, comprehensive documentation of design specifications and configuration settings, and a summary of testing results.</p>
