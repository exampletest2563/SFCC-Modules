<h1>Custom Objects</h1>
<p>Custom objects enable you to extend the Salesforce B2C Commerce model to suit your business needs. They are essentially a new table in the database where you specify the primary key and storage attributes (columns) that meet your business needs.</p>
<h3>Custom Objects Creation</h3>
<p>An example of Custom Object usage is a newsletter. Customers can sign up for it, but the platform does not have a system capable of supporting it.</p>
<p>These subscriptions are intended for export since the platform should not be used for mass mailing campaigns. It is tempting to add the subscription data to the Profile system object, but this would imply that only registered users would be able to sign up.</p>
<p>To enable anyone to get a newsletter, you need to define a Custom Object to represent it.</p>
<p>This Newsletter Custom Object should not be replicable since subscriptions created in staging should not be copied to Production. However, depending on the situation, you might want your Custom Object to be replicable.</p>
<p>You also need to consider how to clean up Custom Objects once they have been exported or after a certain expiration period. This means creating a cleanup batch job that should run on a schedule. You can either create custom objects using Business Manager or programmatically.</p>
<p>You use two Business Manager modules to define and manage your custom objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom Object Definitions</strong>: Facilitates naming, primary key, and column specification. It is located in Administration > Site Development.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Object Editor</strong>: Facilitates instance creation and editing. It is located in Site ‚Äì <site> > Custom Objects > Custom Object Editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you can create a custom object instance, you must first define the custom object data type in Business Manager.</p>
<p>Custom Objects can also store configuration parameters to integrate with external systems, avoiding the need to create multiple Site Preferences. These Custom Objects need to be replicable if the settings made in Staging are suitable for Production.</p>
<h3>Using Script API to Create Custom Object Instances</h3>
<p>Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud Script API provides the following classes in the <strong>dw.object</strong> package, among others:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CustomAttributes</strong>: Attributes defined by a user in Business Manager to extend a system object or Custom Object. Accessible via the syntax: <instancename>.custom.<attributename>.</li>
<li><strong>CustomObject</strong>: Represents an instance of a Custom Object.</li>
<li><strong>CustomObjectMgr</strong>: Enables Custom Object instance creation, retrieval, deletion, and searching.</li>
<li><strong>PersistentObject</strong>: Enables persistent storage.</li>
<li><strong>ExtensibleObject</strong>: Enables custom attributes to be added.</li>
</ul>
<p>Custom Objects persist in the database. Objects of these class types are saved in the database and can be extended to store extra attributes.</p>
<p>The following use of the <strong>CustomObjectMgr</strong> class enables the creation of an instance of Custom Objects by providing the Custom Object type and the primary key:</p>
<p><code>CustomObjectMgr.createCustomObject("NewsletterSubscription", UUIDUtils.createUUID());</code></p>
<p>The code above creates an instance with a system-generated, unique Primary Key. You could also use any other unique value, such as an email sent by the form submission. If the value is not unique, a duplicate PK error occurs. Before creating Custom Object instances with IDs that are not system-generated, it is a good practice to always check if an instance with the value you want to use as PK doesn‚Äôt already exist.</p>
<h3>üìù Exercise: Creating a New Custom Object Type Using Business Manager</h3>
<ul>
<li>Select Administration ‚Üí Site Development ‚Üí Custom Object Types.</li>
<li>Click New to create a new Custom Object type.</li>
<li>Fill in the required fields for the Custom Object type:
<ul>
<li>ID: The unique ID of the object type. It cannot contain spaces.</li>
<li>Key Attribute: This is the unique key for the custom object type.</li>
<li>Data Replication: Specify whether the custom object type data will be replicable to other instances.</li>
<li>Storage Scope: Specify whether the custom object type will be available for a site or for the entire organization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click Apply. The Attribute Definitions and Attribute Grouping tabs become available.</li>
<li>Click the Attribute Definitions tab. Notice the default values created with your Custom Object type. These values cannot be changed once they are created.</li>
<li>When you are finished adding attribute definitions, create an Attribute Group. Click the Attribute Grouping tab.</li>
<li>In the ID field, enter a name for your grouping. In the Name field, enter a name. Click Add.</li>
<li>Add field attributes to the group. Click the Edit link.</li>
<li>To the right of the ID field, click the ellipses to select field attributes.</li>
<li>Select the attributes you wish to add from the list by clicking the checkbox next to each one. Click Select.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Storage Scope and Replication</h2>
<p>One thing that we did not discuss in the System Objects section was Scope because it was not necessary at that point, but now is the time for you to know about it.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs first define what scope is. Consider Scope as the visibility of the object. Who or what can see and use it. We have two options: Organization or Site.</p>
<p>This means that Custom Objects can be created to be visible to all storefronts (Organization) or just for a specific Storefront (Site) in your sandbox. It will really depend on your project.</p>
<p>The Custom Object type itself is always available to the entire organization. Also, you can specify if you want Custom Object instances to be replicable.</p>
