<h1>Getting Data with Models and Sending Data with ViewModels</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We’ve discussed <strong>Controllers</strong>, <strong>Templates</strong>, and briefly mentioned <strong>ViewModels</strong> but without many details. Now, we will explore the differences between models and view models and explain why the SFRA architecture makes use of view models. It would be beneficial to have previous experience with the <strong>MVC</strong> pattern before diving deeper, so if you don’t have this experience, take a look at this <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/model-view-controller-mvc-explained-through-ordering-drinks-at-the-bar-efcba6255053/">link</a> before continuing.</p>

<p><strong>CartModel</strong> is a customized model used to handle the data related to the shopping cart. It allows us to extend and manipulate the standard cart functionality provided by SFCC. For example, you might add custom attributes to track additional information about items in the cart or modify the way the cart calculates totals.</p>
<p>The <strong>Cart Controller</strong>, on the other hand, manages the interactions between the cart model and the storefront. It handles requests from the user, updates the cart model accordingly, and ensures that the data is presented correctly in the view.</p>
<p>By understanding how to extend and use these models and controllers, you can tailor the SFCC experience to better meet your business requirements.</p>

<p>Did you notice that it receives the actual <strong>Basket</strong> as a parameter and adds more data when creating the model? To be sure this is really the Basket returned from the API, let’s check the <strong>Cart Controller</strong> that renders the Cart page:</p>

<p>In this case, it is indeed true that our <strong>Model</strong> and <strong>ViewModel</strong> are the same, as we have just confirmed. That being said, the advantage of having these models is that we can extend them according to our own needs.</p>
<p>For example, if we need to retrieve more data, we can simply add it to the model, and whenever we call it, that data will be included. Keep in mind, however, that this might not always be the best approach. If you need this extra data only for one specific call, it might be a better idea to use <code>getViewData</code> and <code>setViewData</code> inside your controller instead.</p>
