<p>The File API allows web applications to interact with files on the clientâ€™s system, providing a way to handle file uploads and process files locally. Using the File API, you can read the contents of files, access file metadata, and handle file input from the user.</p>
<p>Key components of the File API include the <code>File</code> and <code>FileReader</code> interfaces. The <code>File</code> interface represents file objects, providing properties such as <code>name</code>, <code>size</code>, and <code>type</code>. The <code>FileReader</code> interface enables asynchronous reading of file contents, offering methods like <code>readAsText</code>, <code>readAsDataURL</code>, and <code>readAsArrayBuffer</code> for different file formats. This API is particularly useful for handling file inputs in forms and processing file data without needing server-side interaction.</p>
