<h1>Transactions</h1>
<p>Where you work with objects, whether System or Custom ones, there is one essential detail you must be aware of. You can retrieve objects as much as you want, but when you want to create, edit, or delete an object, things are different.</p>
<p>A transaction provides a context for performing atomic changes to persistent business objects. Before a business object can be created, changed, or deleted, a transaction must be started, and changes to the affected business objects will only be made durable when the transaction is committed.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind whenever you need to create, change, or delete an object instance; you will need a transaction.</p>
  <pre><code>Transaction.wrap(function () {
   ...
});
</code></pre>
<h2>Transaction Types</h2>
<p>We can have two types of transactions: Implicit and Explicit.</p>
<p><strong>Implicit</strong>: This is the example we used above. You just define the code that will be inside the transaction without actually writing any begin or commit commands. If anything fails, the transaction will be rolled back automatically, and the changes will be undone.</p>
<p><strong>Explicit</strong>: In this type of transaction, you are responsible for defining where the transaction begins and ends.</p>
<p>Here you can find examples of Implicit and Explicit Transactions:</p>
