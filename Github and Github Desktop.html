<h2>Module: GitHub and GitHub Desktop</h2>

<p><strong>Introduction to GitHub</strong></p>
<p>GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration, allowing multiple people to work on projects simultaneously.</p>
<p>It uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes and manage code.</p>

<p><strong>Setting Up GitHub</strong></p>
<p>Create a GitHub account by visiting <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> and signing up.</p>
<p>Configure Git with your GitHub credentials using the command:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"</code></pre>

<p><strong>Installing Git</strong></p>
<p><strong>For Mac:</strong></p>
<p>Download the Git installer from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git-scm.com</a>.</p>
<p>Open the downloaded .dmg file and follow the instructions to install Git.</p>
<p>Verify the installation by running <code>git --version</code> in the Terminal.</p>

<p><strong>For Windows:</strong></p>
<p>Download the Git installer from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git-scm.com</a>.</p>
<p>Run the downloaded .exe file and follow the installation wizard steps.</p>
<p>Verify the installation by running <code>git --version</code> in Command Prompt or PowerShell.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction to GitHub Desktop</strong></p>
<p>GitHub Desktop provides a graphical interface to interact with GitHub repositories.</p>
<p>Download and install GitHub Desktop:</p>
<p><strong>For Mac:</strong></p>
<p>Download GitHub Desktop from <a href="https://desktop.github.com">desktop.github.com</a>.</p>
<p>Open the downloaded .dmg file and drag the GitHub Desktop icon into the Applications folder.</p>
<p>Launch GitHub Desktop from the Applications folder and sign in with your GitHub credentials.</p>

<p><strong>For Windows:</strong></p>
<p>Download GitHub Desktop from <a href="https://desktop.github.com">desktop.github.com</a>.</p>
<p>Run the downloaded .exe file and follow the installation steps.</p>
<p>Launch GitHub Desktop from the Start menu and sign in with your GitHub credentials.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a Repository</strong></p>
<p>On GitHub, click the “+” icon and select “New repository.”</p>
<p>Name your repository, add a description, and choose the visibility (public or private).</p>
<p>Initialize with a README if desired, then click “Create repository.”</p>
<p>Alternatively, use GitHub Desktop: Click “File” &gt; “New repository,” then follow the prompts.</p>

<p><strong>Cloning a Repository</strong></p>
<p>To clone a repository, copy the repository URL from GitHub.</p>
<p>In GitHub Desktop, click “File” &gt; “Clone repository,” then paste the URL and choose the local path.</p>

<p><strong>Making Changes and Committing</strong></p>
<p>In your local repository, make changes to files as needed.</p>
<p>Use GitHub Desktop to view changes. Select the files to commit and add a commit message.</p>
<p>Click “Commit to main” (or your current branch name) to save changes locally.</p>

<p><strong>Creating and Managing Branches</strong></p>
<p>Branches allow you to work on different versions of your code simultaneously.</p>
<p>In GitHub Desktop, click “Current branch” &gt; “New branch,” then name your branch and click “Create branch.”</p>
<p>Switch branches by selecting them from the “Current branch” dropdown.</p>
<p>Merge branches by selecting the branch you want to merge into, then click “Branch” &gt; “Merge into current branch.”</p>

<p><strong>Deleting a Branch</strong></p>
<p>To delete a branch using GitHub Desktop, first switch to a different branch (you cannot delete the branch you are currently on).</p>
<p>Click on “Current branch” and select the branch you want to delete.</p>
<p>Click on “Branch” in the menu and select “Delete” from the dropdown.</p>
<p>Confirm the deletion when prompted.</p>

<p><strong>Pushing Changes to GitHub</strong></p>
<p>To push changes from your local repository to GitHub, click “Push origin” in GitHub Desktop.</p>
<p>Ensure you are on the correct branch and that your commits are up to date before pushing.</p>

<p><strong>Pulling Changes from GitHub</strong></p>
<p>To pull updates from the remote repository, click “Pull origin” in GitHub Desktop.</p>
<p>This ensures your local repository is synchronized with the remote repository.</p>

<p><strong>Resolving Merge Conflicts</strong></p>
<p>Merge conflicts occur when changes are made to the same part of a file in different branches.</p>
<p>GitHub Desktop will notify you of conflicts. Use the built-in conflict resolver or manually edit files to resolve conflicts.</p>
<p>After resolving conflicts, commit and push changes as usual.</p>

<p><strong>Example Workflow</strong></p>
<p>Create a new branch for a feature: “Feature/new-login-page”</p>
<p>Make changes and commit locally: “Added login page”</p>
<p>Push changes to GitHub, then create a pull request on GitHub for review.</p>
<p>After review, merge the pull request and delete the branch if no longer needed.</p>
